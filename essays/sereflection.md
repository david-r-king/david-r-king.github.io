  <h2> Reflecting on Software Engineering </h2>
</div>

This class introduced us to more detail of the process that comes with software engineering. Up to this point, the extent of our coding experience has been writing a program in an IDE to meet a submission date. This was the first class I have taken involving multiple pieces of technology, group projects, and common mothedologies. This exposure helped me learn how much more effort goes into large applications, far beyond writing the correct code to meet an objective. Specifically, this course helped me understand the importance of Agile Project Management, Configuration Management, and Design Patterns.

  <h2> Agile Project Management and Issue-Driven Development </h2>
</div>

Project management is a common term I think most people can assume correctly. One particular type of project management we focused on in this course was Agile Project Management. This approach is useful in organizing and managing software projects by attempting to break large problems or work that needs to be done into small, incremental tasks that can be completed and implemented quickly. This format emphasizes flexibility, collaboration and continuous improvement.

Issue-Driven Project Management is what we used during our capstone group project. This consisted of clearly identifying a goal we had in mind, then breaking that into smaller, more digestable, goals and tracking them in a shared repository. These issues could represent a specific task, bug, feature or improvement. In doing this, everyone on the team had an overview of what still needs to be done and what others are currently working on. Our developers were able to select an issue to work on, create a branch off of our main repo, then submit and review changes through pull requests.

With this being the first group project I have been a part of, it easy to notice the benefits of this type of working environment. There was almost always very clear understanding in what the team as a whole needed to do and simple steps to take for continous improvement. This mitigated the possibility of any one member of the team being confused, overwhelmed, or unsure in how to move forward. While we only had a few weeks of exercise in this space, it's fairly obvious how beneficial this kind of workflow is in the practical world of software engineering and development.

  <h2> Configuration Management </h2>
</div>

Another massive benefit I took from this class is configuration management. Put simply, this is the process of controlling changes to software over time. Tracking versions of the code, managing different branches, handling dependencies and ensuring the development, testing and production environments all remain consistent.

Before this class, I did not have much exposure to the importance of configuration management. I was familiar with basic version control and understood that different parts of a system needed to remain compatible, but this was my first time working with multiple parts that changed often. The project really opened up the experience of encountering unexpected configuration issues and working through how to fix them. While they were usually a simple fix, it showed me that it does take some time and energy as the project progressed, unlike the set and forget I had been used to.

I think this was one of the most valuable aspects of the final project, and the course as a whole. I had began to get frustrated with the previous coursework, as I was not confident in truly understanding how software was developed. I could write lines of code that printed something to the console, but connecting that to a fully functional website was all blank space in my mind. With this course filling in the gaps, I do feel more educated in software development overall.

<div class="text-center">
  <h2> Design Patterns </h2>
</div>

Another topic we covered in this course was design patterns. Intuitivley, I had assumed a design pattern was just a structured way to write a program for readabilities sake. Which is correct, but a very surface level definition. From what I understand, design patterns are a reusable stack of solutions to common problems that show up in software development that make code easier to read, expand, and maintain.

The most obvious design pattern I noticed during our project would be the separation of server/client component files. Having two files that work together to provide one feature, but are separated based on what they are providing helps keep the program organized and mitigates developer errors. With this implemented, developers are not required to mentally separate database code from UI code in the same file. 

While I only had a taste of design patterns, I'm sure there are many more that apply to every aspect of software engineering. Now that I have a frame of reference, I will have an idea of what to look for in the future to build upon my knowledge.

  <h4> Conclusion </h4>
</div>

While we did plenty of coding in this class, it was a great opportunity to learn more about the other parts of software engineering. Pulling back the hood to see how software and web applications are actually built gives me more confidence than I had when I started the course. The hands-on experience with the group project was also a really good teacher. It helped me naturally make connections to what we had learned about in class and highlighted the importance of everything not related to physically coding.
