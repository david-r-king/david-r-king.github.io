  <h2> - How Bootstrap 5 Changed the Way I Build Websites - </h2>
</div>

<p>
When I first started learning front-end design, I wrote everything in raw HTML and CSS. That worked fine for simple pages, but once I wanted layouts that adjusted for phones, tablets, and desktop screens, things got complicated fast. UI frameworks like <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong> exist to solve that problem. They give developers a collection of pre-built styles, responsive grids, and components so you can focus on layout and content rather than reinventing the wheel every time.
</p>

<p>
Bootstrap saves hours of debugging and makes sites look professional almost instantly. Instead of spending time writing media queries or figuring out spacing rules, you can rely on tested, consistent classes that behave predictably across browsers.

  <h4>My Experience with Bootstrap 5</h4>
</div>

<p>
Working on the <strong>Banyans Kailua Home Page</strong> was my first real project using Bootstrap 5. At first, it felt confusing — there were so many classes and naming conventions. But once I understood the logic behind the grid system and responsive utilities, things started clicking.
</p>

<p>
For example, the <code>container</code>, <code>row</code>, and <code>col</code> classes handled alignment far better than my hand-written CSS. The <strong>navbar</strong> component was another big help. It automatically converted my top menu into a collapsible hamburger when the window resized, something that would have taken me hours to code manually.
</p>

<p>
I also discovered how <strong>Bootstrap Icons</strong> make it easy to add clean, scalable graphics without hunting for individual image files. By the time I finished the Banyans project, I appreciated how frameworks balance structure and freedom — you can build something custom while keeping it consistent.

  <h4>Comparing Bootstrap with Plain CSS</h4>
</div>

<p>
Before Bootstrap, I built small projects by writing all the CSS myself. That worked fine for learning, but scaling it up was difficult. Every new section required more CSS, more testing, and more problems with layout shifting. With Bootstrap, I noticed how much cleaner my code became.
</p>

<p>
Using Bootstrap doesn’t mean giving up creativity — it just handles the repetitive details. Once I understood that, I realized frameworks aren’t “training wheels,” they’re accelerators. You still need to understand how CSS works, but Bootstrap lets you apply that knowledge faster and more effectively.

  <h4>The Challenges of Learning a Framework</h4>
</div>

<p>
The main challenge I faced was remembering class names and figuring out which combinations created the look I wanted. Reading the official documentation became a regular part of my workflow. It was frustrating at first, but eventually I saw that’s part of the process — learning how to read documentation is just as valuable as learning syntax.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, Bootstrap’s built-in spacing or color styles didn’t match my design vision, so I had to override them in my own CSS. That’s when I realized frameworks aren’t meant to do <em>everything</em> for you; they provide a foundation to build upon.
</p>

  <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
</div>

<p>
Building Banyans Kailua taught me that UI frameworks are not shortcuts — they’re tools that encourage better structure, accessibility, and responsive design. Bootstrap 5 helped me understand how professional websites maintain consistency across every device.
</p>

<p>
In the end, the time I spent learning Bootstrap was worth it. It gave me a clearer idea of how front-end frameworks work and how they fit into real-world development. More importantly, it taught me how to create something that looks modern, responsive, and ready for users — not just for a class project.

  <h4>Screenshot Example</h4>

<p>
Here’s an example of my <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong> project, modeled after the real Banyans website:

The responsive navbar, centered hero text, and adaptive grid all use Bootstrap components.

  <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
</div>

<p>
UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5 make web development approachable and scalable. They reduce repetition, simplify responsive layouts, and maintain design consistency. At first, frameworks seem like an extra layer of complexity, but they actually remove a lot of the frustration from building modern web pages.
</p>

<p>
Once you get past the learning curve, you start to see them not as crutches, but as <em>collaborators</em> — speeding up your workflow while still leaving room for creativity.
