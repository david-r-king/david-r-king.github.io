  <h2> Bootstrap 5 Framework </h2>
</div>

<p>
Growing up, I was a big fan of Legos. I enjoyed seeing a bunch of little plastic blocks that meant nothing by themselves, but putting them together in a structured way created something complex and unique. This is how I view UI frameworks like <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong>. The reusability and flexibility make creating a website more like putting the blocks together instead of rewriting the same tedious code again and again. The ability to reference built in features like colors, social media, spacing and layouts speeds up the process by quite a bit. So far it's been very user friendly and easy to make small changes or modifications. I fully understand why it's seen as one of the staples of modern website development.

We just started using Bootstrap 5 in class and I was surprised how simple it was to develop a clean and attractive website. Instead of handwriting custom CSS containers as I go, I could reference the majority of the site and add what I need to. It's also incredibly easy to read and understand what's happening, which is the first for me when it comes to coding. Using a variable title for a container that has attributes like "height" or "color" make it simple to make my changes. It has been a little tricky at times, with using one container for multiple elements I'm sometimes changing things I don't want to, but I've been better about catching it before it happens. In class, we just recreated the Banyans Kailua website and it showed how powerful this framework is using just a few Bootstrap classes. It's also really good for troubleshooting given the basic verbiage it uses and I was able to see adjustments I made in almost real time.

Overall, working with Bootstrap 5 has made my class assignments far easier and expanded my knowledge on how websites are built. For me, it's helped me keep things organized and saved me time while still building a clean webpage. My favorite part would have to be the built-in responsiveness to adjust for screen size. I used this when I first created my portfolio, though I wasn't sure exactly what I was doing then, it was still fairly simple. I wouldn't even know where to begin to have a website adjust based on mobile or desktop machines, so I am thankful Bootstrap 5 exists. I'm still learning and have a long way to go, but I can tell this framework has had a huge impact on the industry.</p>
