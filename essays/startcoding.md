  <h2>Exploring TypeScript Through the Lens of Python</h2>
</div>

Introduction

My introduction to programming began in 2022 with Python, which as most know, is a very user-friendly syntax with high readability. At the time, I was only experimenting and had no plans to learn any other languages or get involved in software development. With it's readability, it was a great starting point for learning foundational concepts such as loops, functions and conditional statements. Once I had my fill, I put Python and programming down for a couple years. Fast forward to my first semester at UH Manoa, we started learning Java in my ICS 111 class. Even though I hadn't touched an IDE in years, some of the simple concepts were still alive and well in my head. This made the transition to Java much easier than it would have been otherwise, as the language itself is a little more complex than Python. Building on that exposure to more complex languages, we have now transitioned to Typescript and it feels like a logical step. The importance of types and structure makes it feel similar to Java, which has helped the transition feel more natural.

Key Similarities

One of the most obvious similarities between Java and Typescript is they both rely on strong typing, which I appreciate. For me, it has made it easier to understand what is happening and reduces any accidental type-mismatches. Variables, functions, and classes are tied to specific data types across both languages, which forces the programmer to be more accurate about how the data is handled. This strict type discipline helps to catch errors earlier and makes debugging easier as the program grows. Aside from typing, both Java and Typescript put emphasis on structure and object-oriented programming. The use of classes, inheritance and encapsulation are found in both and allow the programmer to create blocks of malleable, reusable code. The syntax is moderately different, however, the same structural mindset developed for Java does carry over quite well to Typescript. This has helped make it feel less like learning a new language and more like applying rules I'm already familiar with, just in a different context.

Key Differences

On the surface, these two languages look very similar with their syntax and structure, however, there are a few key differences that stand out. Java is a compiled language that runs on JVM (Java Virtual Machine), meaning the programs built in an IDE are translated to bytecode and that translation is passed through JVM in order for it to run. Typescript, on the other hand, is a superset of JavaScript and instead of bytecode, is translated into JavaScript before executing. This gives a different back-end workflow between the two and highlights TypeScripts closer connection to web development, unlike Javas connection to enterprise systems and backend applications. Another difference would be in the syntax itself, as the same concepts are found in both, the execution of these concepts in TypeScript feel a little lighter and less robust than what is found in Java. The third and final difference I have noticed lies in the development environment. Java is mostly constructed and ran in heavier IDEs such as Eclipse and IntelliJ, which allows for deeper integration in large projects. TypeScript seems to be ran on more light-weight editors like VSCode, allowing for real-time error checking and autocomplete that make it feel a little faster, less heavy and easier to work with.

Athletic Software Engineering

I really like the idea of Athletic Software Engineering, as repetition is incredibly important for building a skillset. Treating coding the same way you would treat anything you want to get better at by leveraging consistent practice and it can only help in my opinion. I took a 3 month break from programming and most of the concepts stuck around, but the execution suffered severely. This showed me that programming is much like playing sports or an instrument, if you step away for too long you risk losing the sharpness and fluidity that comes with daily practice. The athletic model, and taking time off over summer, is not just about memorizing theory, but about muscle memory and problem solving. I also enjoy the in class and practice WODs, it gives me a project I can sit and practice with instead of trying to come up with something on my own, and aren't overly difficult. Overall, I plan on implementing this idea into my study habits in hopes to improve my coding abilities.

Conclusion

At the end of the day, I am grateful that I started off with Python. It allowed me to get a foothold on some of the foundational concepts that might have slipped past me in a more syntax-heavy language, such as Java. The transition from Python to Java helped me build onto that foundation by slowly (or not so slowly) introducing me to a more structured and strongly typed environment. With the addition of TypeScript, I can see how those same concepts I learned years ago still apply, only in a different framework. For me, Java was a difficult language to get down but TypeScript feels significantly easier and I strongly believe that's due to four semesters of focusing on Java. Even though my career plans right now don't include software development or engineering, I am excited to continue learning more about the language and to apply it wherever possible in the fields of information security or network engineering.
