  <h2>From Python to TypeScript: A Side Journey Through Programming</h2>
</div>

First Impressions

My first experience with programming came in 2021 when I began experimenting with Python. At the time, I wasn’t aiming to become a software developer — I was simply curious about what code could do. Python immediately felt approachable: I could build a basic “choose your own adventure” text game using only loops, conditionals, and simple functions. The language’s readability and flexibility encouraged exploration, and I quickly realized how a few lines of code could create something meaningful.

Later, I encountered TypeScript while exploring web development. My first impression was that it felt familiar to JavaScript but far more disciplined. TypeScript’s compiler immediately pointed out mistakes that Python would have allowed me to run into at runtime. What felt like a safety net for beginners in Python became a training ground for professional development with TypeScript.

How It Compares

Python and TypeScript target different goals, and learning both highlighted their contrasts:
	•	Typing:
	•	Python: Dynamically typed — fast to write but easy to make silent mistakes.
	•	TypeScript: Statically typed — requires more upfront effort but prevents hidden bugs.
	•	Tooling:
	•	Python: Simple interpreter; flexible but less strict.
	•	TypeScript: Strong IDE support with autocompletion, error checking, and refactoring tools.
	•	Scalability:
	•	Python: Best for quick scripts, automation, and prototyping.
	•	TypeScript: Designed for larger projects where structure and maintainability matter.
	•	Learning Curve:
	•	Python made it easy to get started, while TypeScript made me think like an engineer.

Together, they gave me a broader perspective: Python taught me logic and creativity, while TypeScript taught me discipline and structure.

Applied to Software Engineering

Studying software engineering emphasizes maintainability, scalability, and reliability — qualities TypeScript enforces by design. In comparison:
	•	Python sparked my interest in solving problems quickly but didn’t always prepare me for larger systems.
	•	TypeScript introduced principles that align with engineering practices:
	•	Code reviews and debugging become easier when types act as documentation.
	•	Team projects benefit from consistency enforced by the compiler.
	•	Automation scripts can be transformed into robust, production-ready tools.

This combination has real value in my focus on networking and information security. For example, while Python remains my go-to for quick automation (like scanning with Nmap), TypeScript pushes me to build tools with more reliability and scalability. In many ways, learning TypeScript has been like moving from hobbyist coding to professional software engineering.

Final Thoughts

My programming path reflects a shift from exploration to engineering. Python made programming accessible and exciting; TypeScript made it structured and sustainable. Learning both has expanded my ability to:
	•	Solve problems with efficiency and creativity.
	•	Write code that is both functional and maintainable.
	•	Adapt across languages and paradigms — a skill critical in today’s interdisciplinary tech fields.

For me, Python represents the first step into problem-solving, while TypeScript represents the commitment to engineering excellence. Together, they form a toolkit I’ll continue to use in both networking/security and software development as I grow professionally.
