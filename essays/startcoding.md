  <h2>Exploring TypeScript Through the Lens of Python</h2>
</div>

Introduction

My introduction to programming began in 2022 with Python, which as most know, is a very user-friendly syntax with high readability. At the time, I was only experimenting and had no plans to learn any other languages or get involved in software development. With it's readability, it was a great starting point to learning simple concepts such as loops, functions and conditional statements. Once I had my fill, I put Python and programming down for a couple years. Fast forward to my first semester at UH Manoa, we started learning Java in my ICS 111 class. Even though I hadn't touched an IDE in years, some of the simple concepts were still alive and well in my head. This made the transition to Java much easier than it would have been otherwise, as the language itself is a little more complex than Python. Building on that exposure to more complex languages, we have now transitioned to Typescript and it feels like a logical step. The importance of types and structure makes it feel similar to Java, which has helped the transition feel more natural.

Similarities Between Python and TypeScript

Although Python and TypeScript serve different domains, they share several similarities that eased the transition between the two. Both languages are high-level, abstracting away low-level details such as memory management. Each supports object-oriented programming, allowing the definition of classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. Additionally, both languages are widely used in web and software development, supported by large communities and extensive libraries. This overlap meant that skills learned in Python — such as structuring functions, designing reusable modules, and applying programming logic — could be carried over when working in TypeScript.

Differences Between Python and TypeScript

Despite these similarities, Python and TypeScript diverge in important ways:
	1.	Typing System:
	•	Python is dynamically typed, meaning variables can change type at runtime. This flexibility accelerates prototyping but can lead to hidden errors.
	•	TypeScript is statically typed, requiring explicit type declarations or type inference at compile time. This enforces discipline and reduces runtime errors.
	2.	Execution Model:
	•	Python runs as an interpreted language, executing code line by line.
	•	TypeScript must first be transpiled into JavaScript before execution, adding a compilation step but also enabling earlier error detection.
	3.	Tooling and Error Checking:
	•	Python relies heavily on testing and debugging during runtime.
	•	TypeScript integrates closely with modern editors, offering real-time feedback, autocompletion, and safer refactoring.
	4.	Use Cases:
	•	Python excels in automation, data analysis, and scripting.
	•	TypeScript is primarily adopted in web application development, where large teams benefit from structure and maintainability.

These differences illustrate the shift from Python’s simplicity and flexibility to TypeScript’s emphasis on engineering practices and scalability.

Conclusion

Learning Python first provided a foundation in logic and problem-solving that made the transition to TypeScript smoother. Python fostered curiosity and rapid experimentation, while TypeScript demanded greater discipline and precision. Both languages complement one another: Python remains a powerful tool for quick solutions, whereas TypeScript enforces practices that support long-term, collaborative software projects. Together, they represent two distinct yet valuable approaches to programming — one prioritizing accessibility and flexibility, the other prioritizing structure and reliability.
