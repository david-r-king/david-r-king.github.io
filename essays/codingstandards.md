  <h2> Coding Standards </h2>
</div>

My idea of coding standards has been mostly details like camel-case, naming convention and indentation. I knew that formatting and readability was important, but I was never entirely sure how to make my code more reader-friendly. I thought as long as it works, it's mostly acceptable. In my job at the Convention Center, my work regularly requires me to refer to documentation and topologies written or created by someone else. Having documentation or files that are easier to read, or even just easier to look at, can make a world of difference. Once we started using ESLint, I noticed a few very simple things that I had been overlooking, or ignoring entirely, that make the code easier to read and more uniform across different files.

  <h4> ESLint </h4>
</div>

Being brand new to ESLint, I wasn't sure what to expect and on my first run, I must have had 200 errors on 50 lines of code. Initially this was frustrating and a little confusing, but once I corrected all the errors I noticed that not only did the error markers disappear, the code itself looked better. Details like extra spaces, unused variables, missing semicolons and blocks of code with no space in between all sound trivial, but it really did make the code seem more organized and easier to read. Once I noticed some of the things it was correcting, I started trying to anticipate the same errors and suddenly, my code looked cleaner. A small example of this would be required spacing between functions, which just adds room and makes it easier to see where one function ends and the next begins. Building files out this way helps me understand the logic, as the logic is the only aspect I have to work to understand.

Using ESLint has helped me slow down some and pay attention to how it looks as I'm writing. It has almost forced me to pay attention to practices I hadn't thought about before, or ignored with the intent of fixing it later. Instead of writing code that "runs", I was writing cleaner and more professional programs. I would guess that in the industry where everyone can write a program that runs, style and formatting are a big deal. Especially for large teams, where cross checking and integration play a big role. I think this forced but natural shift in mindset, of writing clean and efficient code, is something that will help in learning more when it comes to software development.

Going off of the large team idea I referenced earlier, I know how important having a cohesive team is when trying to get a job done. When multiple people are contributing to a single project, or different teams have to integrate separate files into one program, inconsistent code styles can very quickly become a distraction. I'm not the best programmer as of now, but I think of it as similar to writing a paper in English. If I write a paper with no paragraph separation or indentation, start sentences with lowercase words and ignore proper punctuation, whoever reads it will be very upset and probably walk away with nothing learned. The same idea applies to writing code, so learning these common practices will make me a stronger individual programmer as well as a more effective teammate in the future.

  <h4> Conclusion </h4>
</div>

At the end of the day, ESLint has shown me that good code requires more than just running. It has helped me understand why it’s so important to put effort into readability, consistency, and professionalism. Time stops for no one, and if we can save some simply by practicing these standards, the benefits will compound for everyone in the long run. Since I’m still in a learning phase, I think now is the perfect time to make these standards second nature.
