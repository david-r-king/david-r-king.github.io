  <h2> How I Estimated </h2>
</div>

I started off the semester very strong with a detailed spreadsheet reflecting each assignment's estimated completion time, a breakdown of any unexpected roadblocks, best guess as to why I estimated accuratley or inacurratley, and how I could improve my estimations in the future. While this process added time to each project, it was not too much or unreasonable until the demand for other areas in my life picked up. Even though my intentional effort estimations were short lived, it did help me to internally guage how long some actions take. I think estimating completion time for any action is massivley beneficial and helps to map out the near future, even if it's not a perfect science. 

<div class="text-center">
  <h4> Did Effort Estimation Provide Benefits </h4>
</div>

I was off of my estimates quite a bit, with my limited knowledge at the beginning of the semester there were some assignments I had no idea how to guage. Over some time, forward thinking about what the assignment entails and previous work history, I did get more accurate. I think it's a suitable skill to have in any profession, as there is always a deadline that needs to be met and time management that goes into anyones day.

  <h4> Was Tracking Useful </h4>
</div>

It was useful in a sense of thinking through what needs to be done. I found it incredibley difficult to accuratley think through everything that I will need to do for the project, but without the effort estimation I would have likely started every assignment with a "cold" brain. Forcing us to take a best guess at how long it will take requires some forethought that I probably wouldn't have done otherwise. This translated well in conceptual understanding of some of the technology we were using.

<div class="text-center">
  <h4> How I Tracked My Estimations </h4>
</div>

I used a pretty simple numbers spreadsheet with columns for each of the subcategories of estimation (estimated time, actual time, errors/bugs, use of AI, why I might have been off). 

<div class="text-center">
  <h4> Reflections </h4>
</div>

I think I had a pretty good system for the first few weeks. The only thing I would change is obviously continuing to do it and spending some time after thinking about where I could have done better in the assignment itself. Most of the time, once the assignment was finished and my spreadsheet was filled out, I put it away.
