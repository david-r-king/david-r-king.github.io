### Home Lab â€“ Security Testing and Network Experimentation

I built a personal home lab to practice system administration, networking, and penetration testing in a controlled environment. The setup consists of multiple virtual and physical machines, including **Ubuntu Desktop** and **Kali Linux**, connected through a managed switch and monitored with various tools. This environment allowed me to simulate real-world scenarios while safely experimenting with offensive and defensive security techniques.

A key focus of my lab work involved using **Kali Linux** to perform penetration testing against my Ubuntu Desktop machine. This included configuring network interfaces, testing open ports and services, and exploring ways to identify vulnerabilities through ethical hacking methodologies. By doing so, I was able to gain hands-on experience with both **attack tools** and **system hardening practices**, reinforcing how attackers and defenders operate in practice.

#### Key Activities
- **Penetration Testing Practice:** Used Kali Linux to scan and probe my Ubuntu Desktop machine, testing for exposed services, weak configurations, and potential attack vectors.  
- **Service Hardening:** After identifying weak points, implemented stronger firewall rules, updated packages, and reconfigured permissions on the Ubuntu system.  
- **Network Segmentation:** Connected devices through a managed switch to separate testing traffic and simulate isolated network environments.  
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Observed system logs during testing to understand attack signatures and the importance of logging in detection and response.  

#### Outcome & Learning
The home lab provided a **hands-on environment** to bridge the gap between theory and real-world security.  

- Learned to configure and secure Linux systems under active probing.  
- Practiced common penetration testing workflows with Kali tools like Nmap and Netcat.  
- Understood the importance of proactive patching and firewall configurations.  
- Developed a repeatable environment for ongoing experimentation in networking and cybersecurity.
